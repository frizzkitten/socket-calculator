# Austin Meyer Calculator Coding Challenge

Built off of https://github.com/honey93/OrderKitchen.

# Project consist of both Backend and Frontend code

## Available Scripts

## Backend Code

     cd backend-my-app
     npm install
     node server.js

## Frontend Code

### Root directory except the backend-my-app contains the frontend code.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
<br> For deployment, put the build code into the backend-my-app/build folder <br> and then start the express server

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
